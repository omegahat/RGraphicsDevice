Package: RGraphicsDevice
Title: A framework for developing R graphics devices entirely in R
Description: This package provides a framework that allows one to 
  program an R graphics device entirely within R, i.e. using R functions.
  The motivation is to allow rapid prototyping of graphics devices for new
  formats/targets to be done by those not as familiar with the C--evel details
  of R graphics devices.  An example is a Flash graphics device, i.e. that 
  creates graphical output as Flex/ActionScript code. Another is a device that generates
  JavaScript code that renders on a JavaScript canvas (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial).
  We can then annotate the output from such devices to make them interactive. 
  See the SVGAnnotation package for an example.
